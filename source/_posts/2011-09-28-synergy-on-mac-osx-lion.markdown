#Same mouse and keyboard for Mac and Windows

[Synergy](http://synergy-foss.org/) is a software kvm. It can let you share same set of mouse and keyboard between two different computers through TCP/IP.

##Synergy 1.3.7

I want to setup my Lion as server and Win7 as client. After trying with multiple combination of version and configuration, I found Quick Synergy can at least work.

Problems with 1.4.4 Beta Server on Lion is the keyboard can't use the Shift key in Windows machine. Problmes with 1.3.7 Server is that I can make my keyboard work in Windows machine.

##Solutions

Install Quick Synergy with the above instruction. Simple configuration and save all the hassle.
